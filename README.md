## 🎯 When to Use

AlphaEar is designed for financial analysts, quantitative researchers, and individual investors who need to bridge the gap between unstructured information and actionable trading signals.

- **Investment Research**: Automate the collection and analysis of fragmented information from social media and news outlets to discover hidden investment opportunities.
- **Market Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of "hot topics" (e.g., policy shifts, industry breakthroughs) and their potential impact on specific sectors or stocks.
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Convert qualitative news into quantitative sentiment scores and signal indicators for backtesting or model input.
- **Report Automation**: Generate professional-grade investment reports with structured logic, charts, and references in seconds.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents for Trend Spotting, Financial Analysis, and Report Writing working in concert.
- **15+ Data Sources**: Comprehensive coverage including Weibo, Cailian Press, Wall Street News, and more via `NewsToolkit`.
- **News-Aware Time-Series Model**: Custom **Kronos** integration with a news-projection layer for predicting price shocks.
- **Visualized Reports & Logic Graphs**: High-fidelity HTML reports featuring interactive **Draw.io** diagrams for logic transmission.
- **Dual-Model Architecture**: Optimized routing between "Reasoning Models" (e.g., GPT-5.2) for logic and "Tool Models" (e.g., Ollama).
- **Hybrid RAG Engine**: Combines BM25 (keyword) and Vector Search (semantic) for precise information retrieval.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12+**
- **uv** (Recommended for fast package management)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlphaEar.git
   cd AlphaEar
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Setup Environment Variables**
   Copy the example configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env`**
   Open `.env` and fill in your API keys. AlphaEar supports a wide range of providers:
   - `LLM_PROVIDER`: `openrouter`, `openai`, `ollama`, `deepseek`, etc.
   - `REASONING_MODEL_ID`: Model for complex analysis (e.g., `gpt-4o`).
   - `TOOL_MODEL_ID`: Model for tool usage (e.g., `qwen2.5`).
   - `JINA_API_KEY`: (Optional) Unified Jina API key for both web search (s.jina.ai) and content extraction (r.jina.ai).

### Run

Execute the main workflow:
```bash
uv run src/main_flow.py
```

#### Command Line Arguments
| Argument | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--query` | User query/intent (e.g., "A-share tech sector") | `None` |
| `--sources` | News sources: `all`, `financial`, `social`, `tech`, or a comma-separated list | `all` |
| `--wide` | Number of news items to fetch per source | `10` |
| `--depth` | Report depth: `auto` (LLM decided) or an integer limit | `auto` |
| `--template` | ISQ scoring template ID | `default_isq_v1` |
| `--resume` | Resume from the latest checkpoint | `False` |
| `--resume-from` | Checkpoint to resume from: `report` (reuse MD), `analysis` (rerender) | `report` |

The system will start the agent workflow: identifying intent -> fetching trends -> analyzing signals -> predictive modeling -> generating reports. 
Artifacts will be saved in the `reports/` directory.

## 🏗 Architecture

AlphaEar follows a layered architecture to decouple tools, agents, and workflow logic.

    subgraph "Discovery Layer"

    end
```

### Core Components
1.  **Workflow Layer (`main_flow.py`)**: Orchestrates the global state and execution path, supporting checkpoints and resume.
2.  **Agent Layer (`src/agents/`)**:
    *   `TrendAgent`: Scans for hot topics and performs initial sentiment analysis.
    *   `FinAgent`: Validates investment logic, checks stock data, and formulates transmission chains using ISQ templates.
    *   `ForecastAgent`: Integrates time-series models with LLM reasoning for price trend predictions.
    *   `ReportAgent`: Uses a Map-Reduce approach to plan, write, and refine professional reports with interactive charts.
3.  **Infra & Tools (`src/tools/`, `src/utils/`)**:
    *   **Toolkits**: News, Stock, Sentiment, Search.
    *   **Storage**: SQLite for persistence, Vector DB for semantic search.

## 🧠 News-Aware Kronos Model
One of the core innovations in AlphaEar is the integration of a **few-shot news-projection layer** into the Kronos foundation model. This allows the system to not just predict based on historical prices, but to understand the quantitative impact of news events.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/news_bias.png" alt="News Bias Injection Mechanism" width="600">
  <p><i>The news-aware projection mechanism: mapping semantic embeddings to the model's latent space.</i></p>
</div>

- **Projection Layer**: A lightweight linear layer that maps SentenceTransformer embeddings to the hidden state of Kronos.
- **Global Shift**: The projected news bias is added to the hidden representation across all time steps, shifting the model's "latent expectation" before final prediction.
- **Training**: Fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset of historical news-shock pairs verified by LLM reasoning.

### Adding a New Data Source
1.  Create a new provider class in `src/tools/news_toolkit/providers/`.
2.  Register the provider in `NewsToolkit`.
3.  Ensure output format matches the standard `NewsItem` schema.

### Testing
Run the test suite using `pytest`:
```bash
uv run pytest src/tests/
```
